# Load-Testing
# Load Test Repository

This repository contains load testing scripts and test plans created using **Apache JMeter**. These test cases are designed to simulate real-world usage patterns and measure the performance, scalability, and stability of APIs or web services under different levels of load.

## 📂 Contents

- `VARIOUS API.jmx` — JMeter test plan for various endpoint
- `README.md` — Project overview and usage instructions

## 🚀 Features

- Simulates concurrent users and realistic traffic
- Supports file upload and parameterized requests
- Configurable thread groups and ramp-up times
- Easy to customize for different endpoints

## 🧪 Requirements

- Apache JMeter (5.4 or later)
- Java 8 or higher

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Open Apache JMeter
2. Click `File` > `Open` and select a `.jmx` file (e.g., `FILE UPLOAD API.jmx`)
3. Configure:
   - Target server/API endpoint
   - Thread count and ramp-up time
   - File paths or payloads if needed
4. Click the **Start** button to begin the test
5. View results via Listeners (Summary Report, View Results Tree, etc.)

## 📊 Interpreting Results

JMeter allows you to visualize metrics such as:
- Average response time
- Number of requests per second
- Error rate
- Throughput

You can export `.jtl` files to analyze results or generate graphs.

## 📝 Notes

- Always test in a staging or development environment first.
- Gradually increase load to find bottlenecks without causing unintended outages.
